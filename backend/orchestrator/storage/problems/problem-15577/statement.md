Little Ivica received N math grades and wants to calculate their average. He knows that the average of two numbers a and b is calculated as (a + b) / 2, but he still doesn’t know how to do it for multiple numbers. He calculates the average by writing down N grades and repeating the following operations N - 1 times:He chooses two numbers and erases them.He writes down the average of the two chosen numbers.After precisely N - 1 steps, the only number written down will be the one representing the average grade to Ivica. It is your task to determine the largest average that can be obtained this way.
